# GeoRAMOS

The OS booting from GeoRAM

## Features
- Easy bootstrap
- HDD capabilities
- Quick tools access
- Background codelets execution

## Build

Before building georamos image, make sure that ```BOOTBLOCK_DEVELOPMENT``` in ```georam.asm``` is inactive.

Find ```georamos``` image in root folder. Its size must be 4194304 bytes.

Emulation of WiC64 is not available in stock VICE 3.6. Compile VICE 3.7 but before enable USERPORT_EXPERIMENTAL_DEVICES in userport/userport.h.
```
./configure --enable-gtk3ui --disable-pdf-docs
```

## Usage
After poweroff, first, do bootstrap by ```SYS 57077```. ($def5)

Then, anytime, enter GeoRAMOS menu by ```SYS 53240``` ($cff8). This jumps to already bootstrapped Georamos.

You can also bootstrap again by```SYS 53000``` ($cf08) supposed $CFxx is still there.

If all fails do:
```
POKE 49397,0
POKE 49398,0
SYS 57077
```

If this does not work then georam image is broken.

### Emulation
Start emulation by
``````
/usr/local/bin/x64sc -userportdevice 22 -autostartprgmode 1 -autostart /home/honza/projects/c64/projects/georam/georamos.prg -moncommands /home/honza/projects/c64/projects/georam/georamos.vs
```

## Key bindings
1    Help
2    Upload memory area to GeoRAM file
3    Download GeoRAM file to memory
5    Copy file     ??? can i do it without temp mempry???  remove this?
6    Move file     ??? can i do it without temp mempry???  remove this?
7    Create a new directory
8    Delete file or directoru under cursor
9    Menu
0    Exit to Basic
Cursor up and down: Move cursor
Left | Right: Change to next panel or input   !!!!!
RETURN: cd into dir | start PRG
Aarrow left: escape from input
C=+g switch panel to georam
C=+8/9 switch panel to disk drive 8/9
C=+n switch panel to network drive
C=+r refresh directory from source (reload from network or drive)
INST Select file


### Vice positional mapping

The Backspace key is also INSert when you hold the Shift key.

PgUp is Restore.

ESC is RUN|STOP.

Tab key is Control.

The lower left Control key should be the C= key.

the ` key should give you a left-arrow.

# Use cases
- use C64 quick and smooth, avoid floppy shuffling and wait times
- exchange data C64<>pc with ease
- develop on pc and run on real hw
- main features are: ... finish them
- netlets - geoterm providing UI from PHP, allow "links" to download and execute code on c64 while being in geoterm mode (applets)
- applets
- browse web
- access catalogs - google images, fonts, sids, csdb.dk, google maps, database
- net endpoint for DB operations CRUD on collections
- provide collection of best tools (font editor,...)
- facebook like spaces for c64ers ability to display content from c64 and from pc web, style like intros


# TODO
- freeze when executing prg > ~10000B from net
- po net uploadu pak hned nejde udelat reload dir. asi se znicil command get
- footer for network backend
- redraw panel after refresh and upload
- cd to directories
- cd to D64 like a directory
- header for network backend
- scrollable panel
- delete file
- rework panel verticals and scratch panel_vertical_meta (e.g. input_line_XXX_meta)
- make common meta loader (like load_x_state_meta_vector) for non-inputs e.g. input_line_dnld_meta
- go over TODO in code

- convenient function to fill memory 0800-9fff with 00
- backend for disk
- floppy disk directory
- copy georam to network
- copy network to georam - georam always stores PRG without 2 leading address bytes
- upgrade to latest wic64 firware (done to standard fw) and check if hack in get.php is still needed
- help with IP address, mac address
- bookmarks to directories
- Copy and paste clipboard globaly
- file view as petscii and hex
- key shortcuts pro spousteni menu ***, ****
- design UI toolkit
- set default server config in options
- tool sd2iec launcher
- install fastloader
- display free space in georam
- visual memory map 40*25=1000
- translocate  https://github.com/jblang/supermon64/blob/master/README.md
- inspiration from https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/CBM-Command, src https://github.com/CINJ/CBM-Command/tree/master/CBM-Command
### tried and failed quickly
- [ ] jump vector from zero page to easy menu start, e.g. sys 12,, ted SYS 56832


*** keyabord CIA 1 $DC00
$DC0D irq
CIA1 IRG pin je napojeny na CPU IRQ pin
$FFFEâ€“$FFFF is the vector for handling both IRQ and BRK-instructions; it points to 65352/$FF48, nakonec 	JMP ($0314), By default the IRQ vector points to 59953/$EA31

**** patch kernal
Disable kernal at E000 and copy its content into E000 ram. Patch it like wic64 does. You can load the kernal from net.
